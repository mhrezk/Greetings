# Greetings

Peace be upon you all! !اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَةُ ٱللَّهِ وَبَرَكاتُهُ

I am Mohammad! Welcome to GitHub! As a host, it is my honour to be hospitable towards the guest, and I would like to start by giving the visitor an overview of whom I am.

I am a researching and teaching enthusiast that is constantly seeking experiences that broaden my horizon and strengthen my faith, to be able to help people and contribute to society in a positive and constructive manner. 

What is good is for one to take action; what is best is for one to take action, and provide opportunities for others to take action. That is the true legacy. And thus, I strive to become a better man, by becoming a better Muslim.

In an attempt to do so, I created a channel on YouTube to try my best with regards to that endeavour. The channel includes tutorials for various subjects, but I also have a playlist for topics related to the journey of life, in hopes of helping those in need. 

Feel free to peruse its contents at: [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-J7A41qw6Vvqm5zSaSza_w)

Lastly, if there is anything I could help with, please let me know. Ultimately, what matters is the effort placed, but not the outcome yielded; for one controls the former, never the latter.

# Projects

I am currently planning for multiple projects, including developing a video game and creating a portfolio website. However, due to my time being divided between studies,
